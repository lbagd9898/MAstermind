#Mastermind

##Motivation
I completed this project as part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

##Functionality
This project is designed to mimic the board game Mastermind, following the directions provided on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), and be played in the console. For each round of play, the player can choose to either be the codemaker (mastermind) or the codebreaker.

##Computer Codebreaker
If the player chooses to be the codemaker, the computer will take the role of the codebreaker. The computer codebreaker uses a Mastermind strategy developed by Donald Knuth as detailed [here](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf) and will always win the game in 5 moves or less. Check it out! 

##Learning Outcomes
The main purpose of this project was to gain confidence in utilizing Object Oriented Programming in Ruby. Additionally, it was a good opportunity for me to practice writing clean, DRY, organized code. Implementing Knuth's game strategy also gave me good practice at implementing algorithms.
